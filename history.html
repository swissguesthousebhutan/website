                    <p>The Swiss Guesthouse was the first Guesthouse in Bumthang. It is
                        situated at Karsumphe, a historical place with a small, traditional
                        farmhouse, which was once the residence of the famous “Karsumphe Angye”,
                        the older sister of the first King of Bhutan. The old house served as
                        the headquarters of the Dairy and Forestry Project in the seventies,
                        with office and residence for the Project Manager. Because in those
                        days, there were quite a few Swiss Nationals working in the project who
                        met frequently at Karsumphe, the actual name “Karsumphe Guesthouse”
                        slowly disappeared and the guests named it just “Swiss Guesthouse”.

                    <p>
                        “Guesthouse” was probably too big a word in the beginning, since there
                        were only very few guests, mostly travellers to the East in the early
                        seventies, who were staying over night at Bumthang. They were happy to
                        find a place to sleep, some food with the family and a shower after the
                        long journey on the dusty road which was not yet blacktopped. Listening
                        to all the nostalgic stories about this old traditional building one can
                        hardly avoid to start singing the melody of the “Old House of Rocky
                        Tocky”.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the coming up of tourism, a real Guesthouse was constructed and the
                        old house dismantled and shifted behind the new building complex. Some
                        walls, were reused and are still visible today in the terrace. The new
                        Building harbours the Kitchen and the Restaurant on the ground floor.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Soon enough two more buildings had to be added towards the old apple
                        orchard with the last construction completed in autumn 2009. Since the
                        Swiss Guesthouse is run by a cheese maker who was trained in
                        Switzerland, it is obvious that specialities prepared with cheese such
                        as “Fondue” and “Raclette” are served. But also “Bratwurst” and
                        “Röschti” as well as “Züri Gschnätzlets” and many more Swiss dishes are
                        available. Of course, visitors to Bhutan may be more interested in
                        Bhutanese dishes (which are also available with us), but after some days
                        in Bhutan, a change may be welcome. Just try it out!
